What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","\n","Ans.

In contrast, methods in python are used to define the behavior of python object.\n","\n","- Method definition is always present inside the class, while the class is not required to define the function.\n","\n","- Functions can have a zero parameter, whereas the method should have a default parameter, either self or cls, to get the object.\n","\n","- The method operates the data in the class, while a function is used to return or pass the data.\n","\n","- A function can be directly called by its name, while a method can’t be called by its name.\n","\n","- The method lies under Object-Oriented Programming, while a function is an independent functionality.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vqpPF3uUOVaz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Ques2.

What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","\n","Ans. In Python, an iterator is an object that allows you to iterate over collections of data, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

The variable, in this case, is NOT set to zero when the iteration crosses the last item, instead, StopIteration() is raised to indicate the end of the iteration.\n","\n","Iterators handle the process of accessing elements one at a time while iterables define the sequence of data. Iterators have both __iter__ (often implicit) and __next__ methods where as iterables have a __iter__ method. We can't directly iterate over an iterator using for loops, but one can use it to manually retrieve elements using __next__. Iterables, on the other hand, are directly usable in for loops because iter() is called behind the scenes."],"metadata":{"id":"A2ruQD1M5wF1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Ques 6.
